  <p id="para2"><span id="qot1">"</span>It is with great appreciation and gratitude I wish to record that I have benefited with complete recovery from Dr.Manoj's Homeopathy. I had a small pimple size red spot on my leg and it started growing big in no time with pain while standing during work hours, I had seen the best Skin Specialist in three top hospitals, the specialist failed to identify and diagnose what is that small spot turning into a big area.In severe desperation, I had to see a homeopathy doctor who failed and recommended to Dr.Prudvi Raj, I was reated and healed in no time.</p>
